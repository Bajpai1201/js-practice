JavaScript primarily has six basic data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, and Object. Additionally, ES6 introduced Symbol for unique identifiers, and ES2020 introduced BigInt for large integers. 

ECMAScript standards are crucial as they define the specifications for JavaScript. Key milestones include ES6 in 2015, which introduced major features like arrow functions, let/const, and classes. ES2017 brought in async/await for better asynchronous programming.
